# Pass-Craft

## Description

"This week's challenge was our first experience with JavaScript. The goal was to create a password generator with certain guidelines. The main objective was to create a function so that the user can create a password to their liking. The user is given the opportunity to choose how long they want their password to be, and whether or not they want lowercase, uppercase, numeric, or special characters in their password. If they do not fit the criteria of any of these options, they would receive an alert with instructions to start over. Once the user has input their preferences, the function would then generate a password according to the user's specifications. This included making sure that the password met a minimum length requirement, and that it included at least one of each of the character types that the user had specified. Overall, this was a challenging but rewarding experience, as i was able to learn a lot about JavaScript and password generation. I am proud of the password generator that I have created, and believe that it will be a useful tool for anyone looking to create a secure and unique password. "
